# **Description**:
This analysis explores the relationship between happiness and the four following factors:

-Wealth

-Health

-Corruption

-Safety

Using real-world survey and socioeconomic data, the analysis identifies which of these factors have the strongest impact on happiness and provides insights into how they interact.

# **Key findings**:
-Health shows the strongest correlation with happiness.

-Wealth follows closely as a major driver.

-Corruption also plays an important role, one that is slightly lower in impact than wealth and health, while safety seems to have little to no impact (at least beyond a certain threshold).

**Ranked impact on happiness:**

-Health

-Wealth

-Corruption

-Safety
